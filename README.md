# RSVI

Analysing remotely sensed vegetation indices and their response to drought.

This repository contains R code. For a demo knit the RMarkdown file `vignette_rsvi.Rmd`.

## Site selection

Site selection was done based on:

1. Site where fLUE method worked and where clear soil moisture droughts were identified. I.e., site belongs to clusters cDD, cGR, or cLS as described in Stocker et al. (2018) *New Phytologist*.
2. Site was among the subset of homogenous sites, selected by Manuela Balzarolo. All sites with a homogenous surrounding are listed in file `data/FLUXNET-2015_Tier1/meta/fluxnet_quality_check_homogenous_OK_PRI_mbalzarolo.csv`.
