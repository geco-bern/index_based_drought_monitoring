# Index Based Drought Monitoring

Explorations in using the full spectrum of MODIS bands and contemporary vegetation indices to better quantify their sensitivity to soil droughts.

The analysis was limited to locations where soil droughts could be quantified based upon ecosystem fluxes as described in Stocker et al. (2018). Sites are limited to those as listed in this publication, further limited to those with a relatively homogeneous vegetation.
